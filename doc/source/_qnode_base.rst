-------

With ``pysui GraphQL`` implementation a number of pre-built and ready to use QueryNodes were delivered as part
of the pysui package.

The pre-built QueryNode module :py:mod:`pysui.sui.sui_pgql.pgql_query` contains QueryNodes for
a number of query and execution classes requiring only simple parameters. Many of the QueryNodes include
pagination options.
