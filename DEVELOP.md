## Run Local
To run locally, especially useful when devnet is down, below are the steps to follow:

### Setup local (example from home directory)
1. `mkdir sui_local` from your home directory
2. `sui genesis --working-dir sui_local/`
3. `sui start --network.config sui_local/network.yaml`
4. Open another terminal
5. If you haven't already, setup your `pysui` environment as shown [above](#setup-environment)
6. Prefix `pysui` commands with `--cfg ~/sui_local/client.yaml`

Example:
```bash
python -m samples.wallet --cfg ~/sui_local/client.yaml gas
```
